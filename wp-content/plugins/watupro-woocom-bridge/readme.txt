== Description ==

This bridge allows you to sell access to your quizzes through Woocommerce.
Simply add your quizzes as products in Woocommerce and create a custom attribute with name "watupro" and value the ID of the quiz. You can get the ID from the quiz shortcode.
The quizzes must already require payments (Watupro  + Intelligence module required).
The price of the Woocommerce products does NOT need to match the price you have entered for the quiz in Watupro.
This allows you to create various discounts and bundles.

== Installation ==

1. Unzip the contents and upload the entire `watupro-woocom-bridge` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
